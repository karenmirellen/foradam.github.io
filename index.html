            <h2>To the most handsome man in the world </h2>
            <p>I wrote a text talking about how much I love you and how cliché it's to write texts saying how much I love you, and at the end of the text, I said that I hoped that one day you could feel the same way about me. But the funny thing is, a day later, you said you love me, lol. Okay, I'll try not to be so gay, but you know, I'm gay. I think it's important to tell you and try to show you how much I care and how I feel about you.</p>
            <p>I like our relationship; you're my friend, my boyfriend, my cook, my nerd guy, my tech guy – you've been many things to me since I met you. Pause, I'm crying now, and I feel extremely ridiculous, but in my defense, I'm on my period, and I cried trying to write this online letter because after over 4 hours of work, my code didn't work, so forgive me. </p>
            <p>Adam what I want to say is thank you for being so understanding and loving these 9 months together, I know time is short but I enjoy living every moment I can with you. Sorry for pressuring you and happy valentine's day</p>
            <p>With all my love,</p>
